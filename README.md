Hello, I am @stellashania, I am a passionate UI/UX designer dedicated to crafting intuitive and innovative solutions. Graduating from Bina Nusantara University's Computer Science Global Class program, I developed a keen interest in app development and interface design. Through internships and projects as a Web Developer and UI/UX designer, I further honed my skills and gained hands-on experience in UI/UX design, as well as front-end and back-end development. I love meeting new people and working in a team as I believe collaboration allows us to achieve greater things. Currently, I am focused on UI/UX development, leveraging my experience from the Apple Developer Academy @BINUS to create engaging and intuitive user interfaces. Looking ahead, I am excited to expand my portfolio and continue growing as a UI/UX designer, aiming to deliver seamless digital experiences that delight users.
