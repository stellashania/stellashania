Hello, I am @stellashania, I am a third-year undergraduate computer science student at Bina Nusantara University with an interest in front-end web development. I am self-motivated, hard-working, and passionate about leveraging and utilizing my web development skills to create websites with a heavy emphasis on great user experience. I am looking for an internship position where I can develop and make use of my skills to bring value to the company and my community, as well as to pursue a career as a web developer or UI/UX designer in the future. I love meeting new people and working in a team as I believe collaboration allows us to achieve greater things.
